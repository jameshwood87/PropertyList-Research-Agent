```javascript
// Phase 1: Context Awareness
this.contextService = new ContextAwarenessService(propertyDatabase, monitoringService);

// Phase 2: Local ML  
this.mlService = new LocalMLService(propertyDatabase);

// Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
this.analyticsService = new AdvancedAnalyticsService(propertyDatabase);
```
