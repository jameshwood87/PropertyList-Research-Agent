# Progressive Deepening System

## Overview

The Progressive Deepening System is an intelligent AI learning mechanism that enhances property analysis quality over time while reducing research costs. Instead of performing the same analysis repeatedly, the system learns from previous analyses and provides increasingly sophisticated insights for the same property.

## How It Works

### Analysis Levels

The system operates on 4 progressive levels:

#### **Level 1: First Analysis**
- **Research Intensity**: Standard comprehensive research
- **Focus Areas**: Basic location, market data, comparables, amenities, developments
- **Cache Usage**: Minimal (first analysis)
- **Expected Quality**: 85%
- **API Cost**: Full cost (all queries new)

#### **Level 2: Enhanced Market Intelligence**
- **Research Intensity**: Focused on market intelligence
- **Focus Areas**: Market timing, investment metrics, risk assessment, seasonal patterns, demographic insights
- **Cache Usage**: Partial (some data cached)
- **Expected Quality**: 88%
- **API Cost**: Reduced (some queries cached)

#### **Level 3: Advanced Predictive Analytics**
- **Research Intensity**: Advanced predictive modeling
- **Focus Areas**: Predictive modeling, scenario analysis, market disruption, long-term trends, comparative analysis
- **Cache Usage**: Moderate (more data cached)
- **Expected Quality**: 92%
- **API Cost**: Further reduced (more queries cached)

#### **Level 4: Specialized Deep Dive**
- **Research Intensity**: Specialized niche insights
- **Focus Areas**: Niche markets, specialized metrics, competitive analysis, opportunity identification, strategic recommendations
- **Cache Usage**: Extensive (most data cached)
- **Expected Quality**: 95%
- **API Cost**: Minimal (most queries cached)

## Key Benefits

### Upgrade Criteria

The system upgrades to the next level when:
1. **Current level is below maximum** (4 levels total)
2. **Previous analysis quality was good** (>80%)
3. **User feedback was positive** (>3.5 rating)
4. **Enough time has passed** (>24 hours since last analysis)
