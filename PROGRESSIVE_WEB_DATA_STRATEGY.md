# 6-Month Progressive Web Data Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the enhanced 6-month progressive web data strategy that intelligently accumulates market intelligence over time, improving data quality and analysis accuracy while reducing API costs.

## Strategy Rationale

### Why Progressive Web Data?

1. **Data Accumulation**: Over 6 months, the system builds comprehensive market intelligence
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces redundant API calls through intelligent caching
3. **Quality Improvement**: Each month adds more sophisticated research capabilities
4. **Market Adaptation**: Queries evolve to capture current market conditions
5. **Historical Depth**: Progressive accumulation of historical data points

### Current System Strengths

- âœ… **Intelligent data source selection** (Feed vs Web Research)
- âœ… **Progressive deepening levels** (1-4 with increasing sophistication)
- âœ… **Historical data accumulation** (4 years already collected)
- âœ… **Cache management** with TTL strategies
- âœ… **Quality scoring** and feedback loops

## 6-Month Progression Plan

### Month 1-2: Foundation Building

**Focus**: Establish comprehensive baseline market data

**Level 1 Enhanced Queries**:
```typescript
[
  `"${city}" "INE" "Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica" "precios de vivienda" "${currentYear}"`,
  `"${city}" "Catastro" "DirecciÃ³n General del Catastro" "property values"`,
  `"${city}" "precio por metro cuadrado" "â‚¬/mÂ²" "Idealista" "Fotocasa"`,
  `"${city}" "mercado inmobiliario" "trends" "${currentYear}" "${currentYear + 1}"`
]
```

**Progression Additions**:
- Month 3+: `"property market analysis" "investment opportunities"`
- Month 5+: `"real estate statistics" "official data" "INE"`

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Comprehensive baseline market data
- Official statistics integration
- Multiple data source validation

### Month 3-4: Market Intelligence Deepening

**Focus**: Regional context and market timing insights

**Level 2 Enhanced Queries**:
```typescript
[
  `"${city}" "real estate market analysis" "investment trends" "${currentYear}" "${currentYear + 1}"`,
  `"${city}" "property market forecast" "price predictions" "Costa del Sol"`,
  `"${city}" "market timing" "seasonal patterns" "property investment"`
]
```

**Progression Additions**:
- Month 2+: `"luxury property market trends" "Puerto BanÃºs" "Golden Mile"`
- Month 4+: `"rental market analysis" "occupancy rates" "vacation rentals"`
- Month 6+: `"property market volatility" "risk assessment"`

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Regional market context
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Investment timing insights

### Month 5-6: Predictive Analytics & Future Trends

**Focus**: Advanced market prediction and risk assessment

**Level 3+ Enhanced Queries**:
```typescript
[
  `"${city}" "property market disruption" "future trends" "${currentYear + 1}" "${currentYear + 2}"`,
  `"${city}" "predictive modeling" "real estate market" "scenario analysis"`
]
```

**Progression Additions**:
- Month 3+: `"market volatility" "risk assessment" "property investment"`
- Month 5+: `"demographic changes" "property demand" "${currentYear + 1}"`
- Month 6+: `"infrastructure development" "impact" "property values"`
- Month 6+: `"market sentiment analysis" "investor confidence" "trends"`

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Predictive market modeling
- Risk assessment capabilities
- Future trend analysis

## Implementation Details

### Progressive Query Execution

```typescript
// Progressive query execution based on level and data quality
const maxQueries = analysisLevel === 1 ? 6 : analysisLevel === 2 ? 6 : 6
const queriesToExecute = searchQueries.slice(0, maxQueries)

// Progressive stopping: more content = earlier stop
if (allMarketContent.length >= (analysisLevel * 2)) {
  console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Progressive stopping: ${allMarketContent.length} content pieces collected`)
  break
}
```

### Enhanced Data Source Strength Analysis

```typescript
// Calculate months since system start (assuming January 2025 as baseline)
const systemStartMonth = 1 // January 2025
const monthsSinceStart = ((currentYear - 2025) * 12) + (currentMonth - systemStartMonth)
const progressionFactor = Math.min(6, Math.max(1, monthsSinceStart)) // 1-6 month progression

// Score based on progression factor (months of data accumulation)
webScore += Math.min(15, progressionFactor * 2.5)
result.reasons.push(`Month ${progressionFactor} of 6-month progression`)

// Score based on historical data availability (progressive depth)
const historicalYears = Math.min(8, analysisLevel * 2 + progressionFactor)
result.historicalYears = historicalYears
webScore += Math.min(20, historicalYears * 2)
```

### Enhanced Caching with Progressive Metadata

```typescript
const enhancedMarketData = {
  ...marketData,
  dataSource: 'web_research' as const,
  dataQuality: strength.sourceQuality as 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
  lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),
  // Progressive deepening metadata
  progressiveLevel: analysisLevel,
  successfulQueries,
  contentPieces: allMarketContent.length,
  researchDepth: analysisLevel * 2 // Indicates research sophistication
}
```

## Expected Progression Metrics
